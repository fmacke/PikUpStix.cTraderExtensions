The decision-making logic behind whether to take profit at the pivot point or support/resistance levels in the Pivot Point 
Bounce strategy generally depends on the market conditions and the trader's risk tolerance. 

Here are some key considerations:

	1. Market Conditions:
		a. Trending Market: In a strong trending market, prices are more likely to break through support or resistance levels. In such 
		cases, taking profit at the pivot point might be more conservative, while aiming for the next support or resistance level could 
		yield higher returns.

		b. Range-Bound Market: In a range-bound market, prices tend to bounce between support and resistance levels. Here, taking profit 
		at the pivot point or the nearest support/resistance level can be more effective.

	2. Risk Tolerance:
		a. Conservative Approach: Traders with a lower risk tolerance might prefer to take profit at the pivot point, as it is a more 
		conservative target and reduces the risk of price reversals.

		b. Aggressive Approach: Traders with a higher risk tolerance might aim for the next support or resistance level, seeking higher 
		returns but accepting the increased risk of price reversals.

	3. Price Action and Confirmation:
		a. Price Action: Observing how the price behaves around the pivot point and support/resistance levels can provide clues. If the 
		price shows strong momentum and volume near these levels, it might indicate a higher probability of continuation.

		b. Confirmation: 
		Using additional technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI, MACD) to confirm the strength of the trend or the likelihood 
		of a bounce can help in making more informed decisions.

	4. Trade Management:
		a. Partial Profits: Some traders might choose to take partial profits at the pivot point and let the remaining position run towards
		the next support or resistance level. This approach balances risk and reward.

		b. Trailing Stops: Using trailing stops can help lock in profits while allowing the trade to continue benefiting from favorable price 
		movements.

	Ultimately, the decision on where to take profit should align with the trader's overall strategy, risk management plan, and market 
	analysis. Does this help clarify the decision-making
